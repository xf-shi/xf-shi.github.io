<strong>Canadian Institute of Actuaries (CIA)’s University Accreditation Program
(UAP)</strong>: This course is one of the mandatory courses under the Canadian Institute of Actuaries (CIA)’s University Accreditation Program (UAP). UAP has moved away from the
course-by-course accreditation method and toward the program accreditation method (the
"Pathway 1 of CIA qualification"). Under the new pathway, to obtain ACIA
(Associate of CIA) professional credential, students need to:
<ol type="1">
<li>Complete a degree from an actuarial program (ACT Specialist or Major) at University
of Toronto and pass a list of mandatory courses. No minimum course grade or
GPA is required as long as students pass all the mandatory courses. The full list of
UofT’s 16 mandatory courses are: ACT240, ACT245, ACT247, ACT348, ACT349,
ACT370, ACT451, ACT452, ACT466, STA257, STA261, STA302, STA314, ECO101,
ECO102, MGT201/RSM219. 
<br/>
<strong>For transition</strong>: CIA will accept an actuarial degree from UofT completed between June 30, 2015 and October 31, 2024 without all the specified mandatory courses.
</li>
<li>Complete the ACIA Module (administered by CIA, projected Spring 2024)
<br/>
<strong>For transition</strong>: a student can be exempt from the ACIA Module if they complete
SOA exam PA and the 8 FAP Modules and assessments by December 31, 2024.
</li>
<li>Complete an open-book ACIA Capstone Exam (administered by CIA, projected Fall
2024).
<br/>
<strong>For transition</strong>: a student can be exempt from the capstone exam by completing
any combination of UAP credits or exams for P, FM, IFM, LTAM, STAM and SRM
by October 31, 2024. The deadline to apply for UAP credits is September 30, 2024.
Details on the new pathway for students can be found here:

<br/>
<strong>Academic Integrity</strong>:
Academic integrity is fundamental to learning and scholarship at the University of Toronto. As a result,
U of T treats cases of cheating and plagiarism very seriously. Please read the University of Toronto’s
Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters available at <a href="https://www.academicintegrity.utoronto.ca/"> University of Toronto website on Academic Integrity</a>

All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be investigated following procedures outlined in the Code
of Behaviour on Academic Matters. If you have questions or concerns about what constitutes appropriate
academic behaviour or appropriate research and citation methods, please reach out to us. Note that you
are expected to seek out additional information on academic integrity from other institutional resources, such as
<a href="https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/">The Office of the Governing Council</a>
<br/>

<!--
<br/>
<strong>Policy on Late Homeworks</strong>
Late homework and/or project reports will be penalized 10% (in absolute terms) of the maximum grade for every
part of a 24 hour period that it is late. For example, if you are 36 hours late and your raw grade was 86%,
then you will receive a 20% penalty and your final grade for that project will be 66%.
<br/>
-->
<br/>
<strong>Policy on Missing Exams </strong>
If you miss the midterm or the final exam for a legitimate reason, then you must contact the instructor within
24 hours of missing the exam (and preferably pre-emp by sending an email explaining the legitimate
reason, e.g., illness). If your missed exam is deemed legitimate, then you will have the opportunity to sit
through a <strong>verbal makeup exam</strong> with the instructor of <strong>no less than 30 minutes</strong>. The content will be the
same covered by the exams, but the questions asked will differ from the delivered exams.
<br/>

<br/>
<strong>Policy on Regrading </strong>
The course regrading policy exists to correct mistakes, and any request should clearly identify the error (for
example, a question that was not marked, or a total incorrectly calculated). Requests to correct such
mistakes must be sent by email to the instructor and the TA, within <strong>48 hrs</strong> after the homework/exam was returned.
Note that if a student requests for a re-mark, the entire assignment may be re-marked. So, the new grade
may go up, go down or remain the same.  
<br/>

<br/>      
<strong>Policy on Collaboration</strong>:
You are encouraged to work together on
the homework. Discussing the homework problems with one another can be a
valuable learning experience. However, it is a violation of the rules on academic
integrity to copy another student's solution and submit it as your own. You
should write up your solutions separately, not referring to a common document.
Furthermore, you should not submit any work that you do not fully understand.
You should be able to start with a clean sheet of paper and without notes or
assistance write out the solution to any homework solution you submit. If you will
do that with every homework you submit, the similarity between your solutions
and those of other students will not arouse suspicion. More importantly, you will
be well prepared for the interviews. You are not permitted to use homework solutions for this course from previous
years or solutions you find from other sources, including the internet.
 If multiple students turn in identical solutions, all of them will receive a zero. 


People caught cheating generally tell a story about being unable to keep up
with the material. First of all, remember that you can submit homework late. Secondly, if there is something going on in your life that makes it hard for you to
keep up, please let me know. That brings me to the following point.

<br/>
<br/>

<strong>Take Care of Yourself</strong>:
It is easy for me to say and hard for all
of us, including me, to do, but taking care of your physical and mental health is
essential, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Life is a marathon, and you need to pace yourself.

Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating well, exercising, avoiding
drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will
help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

If you or anyone you know experiences extreme academic stress, difficult life
events, or feelings of anxiety or depression, I strongly encourage you to seek
support. Counseling and Psychological Services is here to help 24/7, and everything will be confidential: 
<a href="https://mentalhealth.utoronto.ca/">https://mentalhealth.utoronto.ca/</a><br/>
 
In addition, consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family
member you trust for help getting connected to the support. Keep in mind that
for serious psychological issues, the first counselor you meet with may not be the
right one for you, but this does not mean you should give up on counseling. Keep
looking for someone who can help you. <ul>

about which I might be helpful, please let me know.
